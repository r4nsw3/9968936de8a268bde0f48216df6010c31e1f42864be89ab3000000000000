  |   The content patch will add Slime-san as a playable character, a       |
  |   brand new circular arena, and a bunch of new unlockable spheres.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Slime-san, the hero from the game Slime-san, will join SpiritSphere   |
  |   DX as a playable character! Slime-san doesn't have a traditional      |
  |   swinging attack but instead can both dash and jump around the         |
  |   arena, making him one of the most agile characters out there! On      |
  |   top of that, thanks to his slimy body, Slime-san can stretch          |
  |   himself horizontally in the hopes of catching any spheres flying      |
  |   past him! Make sure to play his campaign to experience Slime-san's    |
  |   story!                                                                |

  |   - Say hello to a brand new arena! This circular stage will have       |
  |   spheres bouncing off in all kinds of weird directions! The dojo       |
  |   also comes with its own unique yokai to deal with in target mode.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - A bunch of new unlockable spheres will be added to the fountain     |
  |   including a sphere that randomly changes its type!                    |
  |                                                                         |
